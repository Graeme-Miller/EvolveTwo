A grid is a biome. A world is made up of multiple biomes.

Animals at the edge can transfer between biomes in groups.

Biome:
- Temperature, Flora
- 30*30 grid

Animal:
- have points in energy
- are either carnivore or herbivore
- can spend on:
    first
        - gestation speed
        - litter size
        - metabolism
        - attack

        - time to eat
        - time to sleep
        - speed
        - risk taking?
    later:
        - solitary/group
        - likelihood of biome transfer
- Actions:
    - Eat food/eat other animal
    - Mate
    - Sleep
    - Move Random
